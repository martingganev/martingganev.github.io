                            monuments on Earth, Egypt stands as an unforgettable travel destination. It’s had to deal
                             with its fair share of turmoil in recent times, but this North African nation remains proud,
                              welcoming and accessible. And with treasures as timeless as the temples and pyramids
                               of the Nile to shout about, it’s not somewhere that’s going to slip from public 
                               consciousness any time soon. A trip here still very much has the potential to thrill.
                               In many ways, there are two Egypts. The first is the Egypt of Cairo and the Nile,
                                of bustling medieval bazaars, noseless Sphinxes, river cruises and Agatha 
                                Christie-era exoticism.  The second, and just as integral to many visitors, 
                                is the Egypt of the Red Sea, where a spread of large-scale modern resorts caters 
                                to sun-seekers and scuba divers. <a href="https://traveltriangle.com/blog/summer-in-egypt/"

                              attract many visitors to Peloponnese Greece all year round. Historically, it
                               has been the main field of action for Greece since the prehistoric times. In

                                 Olympia, Epidaurus and Mycenae. Surrounded by sea from all sides, the region
                                  provides amazing beaches. The most famous areas include Nafplion, Gythio,
                                   Monemvasia and Pylos. Here too is Greece's third city, Patras, and Kalamata,
                                    whose tasty olives are exported all over the world. Here's ancient Pylos,
                                     and Sparta, Tiryns and Argos, mountain villages like Andritsaina, 
                                     the curious little town of Monemvasia, hiding away on its offshore

                             European Capital of Culture, it now attracts even more interest. Matera
                              is also known for being a film location with films such as Mel Gibson’s 
                              The Passion of the Christ (2004) making use of its distinctive feel which
                               is reminiscent of Biblical times. The Civita district is the oldest and 
                               highest group of Sassi buildings, with The Cathedral of Matera,
                                built in 1270 dominating the skyline. After Matera was taken over by 
                                Roman Empire, the town started expanding, and Civita took its place
                                 in between two new areas – Sasso Caveoso and Sasso Barisano.

                            Scotland harbours some of the largest wilderness areas left in Western Europe.
                            In this wildlife haven you can see golden eagles soar above the lochs and 
                            mountains of the northern Highlands, spot otters tumbling in the kelp along
                             the shores of the Outer Hebrides, and watch minke whales breach off the 
                             coast of Mull. Scotland's also an adventure playground: you can tramp the
                              tundra plateaus of the Cairngorms, balance along tightrope ridges strung
                               between the peaks of the Cuillin, sea kayak among the seal-haunted isles
                                of the Outer Hebrides, and take a speedboat ride into the white water
                                 of the Corryvreckan whirlpool. <a href="https://www.visitscotland.com/see-do/"

                                 for some time (it’s just a 90-minute drive from the
                                  American border). Now it’s earning itself the lofty 
                                  billing of Mexico’s Napa Valley, for its architect-designed
                                   tasting rooms and complex bottles – many of them

                                The foodie landscape has been maturing as well, drawing on 
                                farm-to-table ingredients and seafood from the nearby Pacific.
                                 One of the area’s best-loved chefs is Javier Plascencia, who
                                  set up in the Valle in 2012, when it first turned heads as
